## Hey there! 👋 I'm Josh (aka Tamely)

Student, game dev, and low-level systems enjoyer. I build game engines, game servers, mess around with cryptography, and do independent security research for Epic Games and Riot Games. I'm always experimenting and always shipping. Hit me up if you’re working on cool stuff!

Check out my [game engine](https://github.com/Tamely/WraithEngine) 🎮.

**What I'm Building:**
- [Wraith Engine](https://github.com/Tamely/Wraith-Engine) – A game engine focused on making developing games more accessible.
- [Reality](https://github.com/FortniteReality) – A 1:1 reverse-engineered authoritative dedicated game server, backend, and XMPP server for Fortnite with completely custom content.
- [ASMTetris](https://gist.github.com/Tamely/97f6a18c20d384b954bfb60e55ee23f8) – Games built with 32 bit x86 ASM to understand them on an instruction level.

**Notable Experiments:**
- Built a game engine from scratch.
- Reverse Engineered and recreated a real-time authoritative game server, XMPP server, and backend.
- Created an Unreal Engine asset tooling platform with over 100k+ users by reverse engineering Unreal Engine asset serialization for both open and closed source engine forks.
- Built a proxy with FiddlerCore to intercept, modify, and analyze Fortnite, VALORANT, and Marvel Rivals API traffic for research purposes.
- Reverse engineered Unreal Engine's content manifest pipeline and ported it to Rust.

**Tech I Like:**
- 🧠 Low-level systems – C/C++, Rust, Assembly, memory management, and serialization.
- 🎮 Game development – Unreal Engine, Roblox Studio, custom engines, tooling, real-time networking, and rendering pipelines.
- 🌐 Backend engineering – Java Spring Boot, Jersey, Node.js, REST/XMPP APIs, reverse proxies.
- ☁️ Cloud & DevOps – Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Cloudflare, GCP.
- 🧰 Reverse engineering & security research – static/dynamic analysis, disassembly, and protocol inspection.
- 🧑‍🎨 Tools & UX – building intuitive editors and debugging tools for developers
